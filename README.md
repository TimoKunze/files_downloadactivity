# Activities for shared file downloads

Creates activities for downloads of files that were shared with other users or a group

The feature is controllable via the `A local shared file or folder was downloaded` setting on the personal page.

Customization by me (TimoKunze): Make all administrators see the activities and not only the person who shared the link.
